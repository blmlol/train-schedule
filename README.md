This project is a simple Train Schedule. The user can dynamically add trains with a name, destination, first departure, and frequency. This information is displayed when the user submits the information. The train names are saved in a Google Firebase Database and the Next Train Time is locally updated in PST every minute to show when the next train time will be based on its frequency and first departure time. 

## Objective
The objective of the project is to combine HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a data storing tool to create a persistent data webpage. The main focus was using a database and providing logic to communicate with the database and dynamically displayed information from the database to the webpage. The user interaction with the webpage is through the input fields and the submit button.
